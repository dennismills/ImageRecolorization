# Image Recolorization

## Project Description
  This project provides an image recolorization implementation based on machine learning and GANs.
  We are colorizing images that were black and white in an attempt to add to the growing amount
  of research on the topic. We are trying to extend the model from its current form into coloring
  videos as well, which the model does with relative success.
